# cs50
A repo containing my labs and problem sets for Harvard CS50. These were developed within CS50's native IDE at https://ide.cs50.io/. Week 0's problem set was created in Scratch so I've included the .sb3 file and a converted HTML version to play the game without loading the project in Scratch. (Props to HTMLifier for easy Scratch to HTML conversion: https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/)

I'm doing CS50 as a course of self-study. I've worked on these as much as I've been able, but ultimately I'm doing these exercises to understand core computer science concepts, and as such, may not be perfectly executed. That's fine, it's all about the learning process and seeing how to apply it to other languages.
