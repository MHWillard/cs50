# cs50
A repo containing my labs and problem sets for Harvard CS50. These were developed within CS50's native IDE at https://ide.cs50.io/. Week 0's problem set was created in Scratch so I've included the .sb3 file and a converted HTML version to play the game without loading the project in Scratch. (Props to HTMLifier for easy Scratch to HTML conversion: https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/)
